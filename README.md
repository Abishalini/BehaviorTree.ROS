# BehaviorTree.ROS

[BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) is a __middleware independent__ framework 
to develop Behavior Trees in C++.

The library is not particularly opinionated about the way Actions and Conditions should be created; this gives
more freedom to the developer, but can also be confusing for those people which are getting started with it.

[BehaviorTree.ROS](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.ROS) provides some practical examples and 
utilities related to [ROS (the Robotic Operative System)](http://www.ros.org).

ROS users can use this library or look at the way Nodes are implemented to implmenent their own version.
